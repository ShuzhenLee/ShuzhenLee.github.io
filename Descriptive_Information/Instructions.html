<p>
    Now the market is about to start.
    However, instead of investing your money for real, we would like you to review the performance of two funds over a series of periods first.

    In Stage 1, you will now examine the performance of the two funds over a new set of <b>45 periods</b>,
    which are separate from the first 10 periods you previously observed.
</p>
<p>
    The data will be presented in charts and tables, appearing one by one.
    After reviewing each chart or table, click "Next Page" to proceed.
    If you wish to revisit a previous page, click "Previous Page".
</p>
<p>
    Now, please click "Next Page" to start.
