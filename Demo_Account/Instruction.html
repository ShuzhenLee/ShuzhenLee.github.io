<p>
    Now the market is about to start.
    However, instead of investing your money for real, we would like you to experience the investment using <b>a demo account</b> first.
    You will be given the opportunity to make real investment after 45 periods.
    Thus, in this stage, you can learn about the performance of the two funds and how your investment decisions affect your portfolio <b>WITHOUT real monetary consequences</b>.
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning of this stage, you will be given 100 ECUs in your demo account to allocate between the Conventional Fund and the Sustainable Fund.
    This allocation will determine the initial composition of your portfolio before returns start being revealed.
</p>
<p>
    The returns for the two funds will be revealed period by period at a fixed speed.
    Once all 45 periods have been revealed, we will summarize the performance of both funds and the portfolio you constructed.
</p>
<p><b>
    While this stage does NOT affect your final earnings in the study, it is designed to provide a hands-on experience in investment decision-making between the two funds.
    Note that the returns are NOT hypothetical or simulated, they are the returns from these two real funds determined by the market.
